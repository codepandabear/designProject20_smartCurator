## Detect the size of body parts using Image-Processing

Follow the Jupyter Notebook for in-detail explanation.

The approach followed -
1. The different images are resized into a common size.
2. Image Segmentation is applied on the images
3. Extreme points in the countours are found.
4. Distance between these extreme points is calculated.
5. Prediction analysis is applied on the obtained data.
6. Viola! You get your shirt size.

* This is a small dataset, I am planning to use Transfer Learning to get more accurate results.
* Also planning to create a web app using Flask.
